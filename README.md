This is a fork of a fork! I forked it from daipenger who forked it from sonicether, daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and cleaned up the codebase, i just added some stuff.

The stuff added in this fork:
* Dynamic environement evaluation (disabled by default, enable in mod config ingame)
* Automatic stero to mono downmixing of sounds (So the original resourcepack is not needed anymore)
* More compatibility with mods (Computronics & Immersive Railroading)
* Server-side support (right position for entity and computronics sounds and higher distance before sound cutoff)

Todo:
* Rewrite/cleanup Dynamic environement evaluation
* More mod compatibility ? I'm open to suggestions
